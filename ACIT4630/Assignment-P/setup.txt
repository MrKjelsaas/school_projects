Preparation:
- Install the following python libraries through pip:
 - numpy
 - pandas
 - pandas_datareader
 - yfinance
 - simfin

- Create a folder named 'Data' in the working directory

- Create a folder named 'Datasets' in the newly created 'Data' folder

- Follow this link:
https://www.kaggle.com/salmaragheb/sp-500-gspc
and place the unzipped file in the 'Data' folder

- Follow this link:
https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EVIX/history?period1=1262304000&period2=1577836800&interval=1d&filter=history&frequency=1d&includeAdjustedClose=true
press the "Download" button, and place the downloaded file in the 'Data' folder



Note:
Occasionally, this script fails because of a bug in the yfinance library.
This happens maybe 1/5 times.
Just try running the script again.

Also, this script takes like 20 minutes to run, so grab a coffee.
